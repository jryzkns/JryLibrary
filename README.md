A quick guide on hex values for colors:

	hexvalues for colors are always a 6 digit number in base 16,it takes the form of "#XXXXXX".

	Each digit can be any of: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F].

	When reading from the left to the right:
		the "#" sign is denoting a hexvalue
		the first two digits denote how much red there is
		the second two digits denote how much green there is
		the last two digits denote how much blue there is

	A helpful way to remember this is to look at a QWERTY keyboard:
		The keys "R", "G", and "B" form an arc together, just like how to digits of rgb line up. 
		Additionally, between R(ed) and G(reen), there is the Y(ellow) key, so Red added to Green is Yellow. 
		Similarly, G(reen) added to B(lue) is the C(yan) key.
